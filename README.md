ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @simonedisomma techologist, large-language-model tinkerer, partner at KPMG, former SAP Head of GenAI Planning & Analytics, and repeat startup founder (backed by Y Combinator). I ship (mainly) Python-powered ideas that turn natural language into working products, contribute to open-source NLP tooling, and mentor teams exploring the frontier where research meets real-world impact. Letâ€™s collaborate!
